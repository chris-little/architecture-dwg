[[JSON_Schema]]
=== JSON Schema standard candidate
JSON Schema is intended for validation and documentation of data models.
It acts in a similar way to XSD for an XML file but adds the capability to describe every object and attribute, offering a way to document data types and its meaning in a human readable form that has no equivalent in XSD.

Indeed, some applications (such us XML Validator Buddy) are able to combine a JSON file with its corresponding JSON Schema to test and validate if the content of the JSON file corresponds to the expected data model. Several implementations of JSON schema validation are also available on-line. An example is the one available in this URL http://json-schema-validator.herokuapp.com/ and the corresponding opensource code available in github https://github.com/daveclayton/json-schema-validator.

The number of aspects that JSON Schema can validate is lower than the ones that XML Schema can control. Some factors contribute to that:

* JSON objects are considered extendable by default. This means that adding properties not specified in the schema does not give an error as result of validating, by default. This prevents detecting object or attribute names with typos (because they will be confused with _extended_ elements) except if they are declared as mandatory (and the will be found _missing_ in the validation process). Please note that JSON schema provides a keyword _additionalProperties_ that if it is defined as _false_, then JSON object is declared as not extensible (and only the property names enumerated in _properties_ are considered valid). Even if this will allow for a more strict validation, it is not recommending because we will be loosing one of the _advantages_ of JSON (this topic has been already discussed in the <<Basic_JSON_considerations>>).
* Objects have no associated data types (or classes). This forces the schema validation to be based in object _patterns_ and not in class definitions.
* Another difference is that JSON properties are not supposed to have order, so the order of the properties of an object cannot be validated. In many cases this is not a problem, since most of the data models used in OGC do not depend on the order of the properties, even if the XML "tradition" has imposed this unnecessary restriction (this topic has been already discussed in the <<Basic_JSON_considerations>>).

WARNING: It is necessary to review the next two paragraphs with thw new version v7

Unfortunately, JSON schema is a IETF draft that expired in August 2013 and the future of the specification was uncertain. One of the authors blogged that he is forced to abandon the project due to lack of time. The project has been reactivated in September 2016 and a new version of the IETF documents has been released with minim changes. New releases with descend compatibility have been promised.

Note that the Internet media type is "application/schema+json". According to the last available draft of JSON Schema (v4), there is not a new file extension proposed for files storing JSON Schemas. The file extension ".json" is used profusely. To make the situation a bit more complex, there is no documented mechanism to associate a JSON instance to its schema (even if it seems that some applications use "$schema" to do this; as discussed in https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/json-schema/VBRZE3_GvbQ). In preparing these examples, we found the need to be able prepare json instances and json schemas with similar file names to make the relation between them more explicit and it was practical to name the schema files ending with "_schema.json".

=== JSON Schema simple example
Lets use a simple feature example encoded in JSON to later illustrate how JSON Schema is useful for documentation and validation.

.Example of a river feature in JSON
[source,json]
----
{
	"river":
	{
		"name": "mississippi",
        "length": 3734,
		"discharge": 16790,
		"source": "Lake Itasca",
		"mouth": "Gulf of Mexico",
		"country": "United States of America",
		"bridges": ["Eads Bridge", "Chain of Rocks Bridge"]
	}
}
----

Now let's define a JSON Schema for validating it. The first thing we need is to start a JSON file with an indication telling everybody that this is a JSON Schema by adding a "$schema" property in the root object of the schema. The value used in this examples reflects the last draft version available some months ago (i.e. v4).

.Indication that this file is a JSON Schema that follows the specification draft version 4.
[source,json]
----
{
	"$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#"
}
----

Title and description are useful properties to describe the schema purpose and the objects and properties it will validate.

.Title and description to describe the schema (or the root element).
[source,json]
----
{
	"$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#",
	"title": "JSON minimal example",
	"description": "Schema for the minimal example of a river description"
}
----

The root element can be an object or an array. In this case we are validating an _object_.

.The root object is an object.
[source,json]
----
{
	"$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#",
	"title": "JSON minimal example",
	"description": "Schema for the minimal example that is a river",
	"type": "object"
}
----

Now it is time to enumerate the properties. The properties array allows to enumerate the property names and to list their attributes. In the next example, there is only one property that is called "river". This property is an object and is declared as required.

.The root object has a single property called "river"
[source,json]
----
{
    [...]
    "type": "object",
	"required": ["river"],
	"properties": {
		"river": {
			"type": "object"
		}
	}
}
----

Since _river_ is an _object_, we can repeat the previous pattern for it. In particular, a river object has a _name_ and this name is an "string".

.The river object has also some properties
[source,json]
----
{
    [...]
		"river":
		{
			"type": "object",
			"title": "Minimal River",
			"required": [ "name" ],
			"properties":
			{
				"name": {"type": "string" },
                [...]
			}
		}
    [...]
}
----

A _river_ has additional properties and some of them are numeric. Please note that in the case of numeric properties, the numeric allowed range can be indicated using _minimum_ and _maximum_. In this case, we are forcing numbers to be non-negative since they represent characteristics that cannot be negative.

.The river properties list
[source,json]
----
{
    [...]
			{
				"name": {"type": "string" },
				"length": { "type": "number", "minimum": 0 },
				"discharge": { "type": "number", "minimum": 0 },
				"source": { "type": "string" },
				"mouth": { "type": "string" },
				"country": { "type": "string" },
				[...]
			}
    [...]
}
----

Now we add a river property that is called _bridges_ and that can contain a list of bridge names. It is encoded as an array of strings.

.One river property is an array
[source,json]
----
{
    [...]
			{
				[...]
				"country": { "type": "string" },
				"bridges": {
				    "type": "array",
				    "items": { "type": "string" }
				}
			}
    [...]
}
----

Finally, we could use one of the JSON online schema validator tools to check the validity of the previous JSON file. There are many online validators and the initial JSON example has been validated with the proposed JSON Schema with the following validators:

* https://json-schema-validator.herokuapp.com/
* http://jsonschemalint.com/#/version/draft-04/markup/json
* http://www.jsonschemavalidator.net/

If we simply change the length of the river to a negative number (e.g. -1) we will get an error report that varies in the text from one implementation to the other but all give us an indication of the problem:

.Response of the http://www.jsonschemavalidator.net/
[source,text]
----
Message: Integer -1 is less than minimum value of 0.
Schema path:#/properties/river/properties/length/minimum
----

.Response of the https://json-schema-validator.herokuapp.com/
[source,json]
----
[ {
  "level" : "error",
  "schema" : {
    "loadingURI" : "#",
    "pointer" : "/properties/river/properties/length"
  },
  "instance" : {
    "pointer" : "/river/length"
  },
  "domain" : "validation",
  "keyword" : "minimum",
  "message" : "numeric instance is lower than the required minimum (minimum: 0, found: -1)",
  "minimum" : 0,
  "found" : -1
} ]

=== JSON Schema for an object that can represent two things
Lets consider now that I need to encode rivers and lakes. In this case, we will need an object that can present itself either as a river or as a lake. We have already seen an example for a river, and we now present an instance for a lake.

.Example of a lake feature in JSON
[source,json]
----
{
	"lake":
	{
		"name": "Tunica Lake",
        "area": 1000,
		"country": "United States of America"
	}
}
----

Obviously, rivers and lakes will have different properties. There is a _oneOf_ property in JSON Schema that allows a thing to present more than one alternative definition. This way both, the previous JSON instance for the river and the one in this subsection, will be validated with the same JSON Schema.

[source,json]
----
{
	"$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#",
	"oneOf": [
		{
			"title": "JSON minimal river example",
			"description": "Schema for the minimal example that is a river",
			"type": "object",
			"required": ["river"],
			"properties": {
				"river":
				{
					"type": "object",
					"title": "Minimal river",
					"required": [ "name", "length" ],
					"properties":
					{
						"name": {"type": "string" },

						}
					}
				}
			}
		},{
			"title": "JSON minimal lake example",
			"description": "Schema for the minimal example that is a lake",
			"type": "object",
			"required": ["lake"],
			"properties": {
				"lake":
				{
					"type": "object",
					"title": "Minimal lake",
					"required": [ "name", "area" ],
					"properties":
					{

						"area": { "type": "number", "minimum": 0 },
						"country": { "type": "string" }
					}
				}
			}
		}
	]
}

=== JSON Schema for an array of features
After showing how to do a single feature (i.e. rivers and lakes, each one in an independent JSON document that can be validated with the same JSON Schema) to show how to represent a feature collections as arrays can be useful. Following this approach, we are able to include rivers and lakes as array items in the same JSON file:

.Example of a river and a lake feature in JSON. Variant A.
[source,json]
----
[
	{
		"river":
		{
			"name": "mississippi",
			"length": 3734,
			"discharge": 16790,
			"source": "Lake Itasca",
			"mouth": "Gulf of Mexico",
			"country": "United States of America",
			"bridges": ["Eads Bridge", "Chain of Rocks Bridge"]
		}
	},{
		"lake":
		{
			"name": "Tunica Lake",
			"area": 1000,
			"country": "United States of America"
		}
	}
]
----

This can be validated by the following JSON Schema, that is very similar to the last one, but defines the root element as an array of items.

					}
				}
			}
		},{
			"title": "JSON minimal lake example",
			"description": "Schema for the minimal example that is a lake",
			"type": "object",
			"required": ["lake"],
			"properties": {
				"lake":
				{

					"properties":

						"name": {"type": "string" },
						"area": { "type": "number", "minimum": 0 },
						"country": { "type": "string" }
					}
				}
			}
		}]
	}
}

JSON is one of these cases where simplicity is highly appreciated. It could be useful to consider a second alternative, where there is not need to use an object name. Instead we will use a "type" property to differentiate among object types and this will result in a notation with less indentations.

	},{

		"name": "Tunica Lake",
		"area": 1000,
		"country": "United States of America"
	}
]
----

This is the corresponding JSON Schema that can be used to validate the array. Note that only "river" and "lake" values are allowed in the "type" key, and any other value will generate a validation error.

In JSON Schema, one can do much more than what has been explained here. Most of the needed characteristics of UML class diagram usually included in OGC and ISO standards, such as, generalization, association, composition, etc can be implemented by JSON Schemas as comprehensively discussed in the OGC 16-051 Testbed 12 A005-2 Javascript JSON JSON-LD ER.

WARNING: It could be useful to describre the role of allOf as a mechanism to extend objects will new properties.

=== Why OGC needs to validate JSON
OGC is transitioning from standards that were written in plain English to a robust way of written standards based on requirements classes that are linked to conformance test classes. Conformance tests are designed to determine if implementations follow the standard. When an XML encoding is involved, standards that provide XML Schema files defining each data type, provide a straightforward way to check if a document follows the standard: _validating_ the XML document with XSD, RelaxNG or Schematron (or a combination of them).

In the same way, when OGC should adopt JSON Schema as an alternative encoding for data models. Standards that propose a JSON encoding should be accompanied by a JSON schema as an automatic way of validating if objects in a JSON file follow the data models proposed by the corresponding standard.
