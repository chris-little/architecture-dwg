||18|*Rule 9.1*: If a UML class is defined as _DataType_ (and potentially used in more that one place in the UML model) it SHALL be defined in the _definitions_ section of the JSON schema and referenced by each attribute that is declared of this _DataType_.|http://www.opengis.net/spec/JSON-BP/1.0/req/json-schema/uml-class-datatype
||19|*Rule 9.2*: If an class is generalized into other classes in the UML, the JSON schema SHALL define the main class properties in the definitions section with the UML class name and the word "Properties" (not including the "type"). |http://www.opengis.net/spec/JSON-BP/1.0/req/json-schema/class-generalization
||20|*Rule 9.3*: If a class is generalized into more than one classes in the UML (which forces the instance to choose one among of them), the JSON Schema SHALL define an object that offers the different options using the _oneOf_ property.|http://www.opengis.net/spec/JSON-BP/1.0/req/json-schema/multiple-generalization
