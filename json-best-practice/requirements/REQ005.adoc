A UML class that is a _aggregation_ or a _composition_ of a parent class, SHALL be considered equivalent to a JSON complex property of the parent object (considering it as the same as a UML complex attribute). The name of the source extreme of the relation (the tip of the arrow) will be considered the name of the complex _attribute_ and the _class name_ will be considered the _type_ of the property.
