All UML class attributes SHALL be listed in a @context object. If the document has more than one "@context", the property SHALL be defined in the "@context" that is closer to it (with the exception of "id" and "type" that are defined in the root "@context" document and always have global scope). The value of the listed properties has to be the abbreviated namespace, the ":" character and the name of the property again.
